# ⚡ Annual electricity consomation by address for companies - Explore Enedis Open Data ⚡

This repository is a **small exploratory project** to practice working with **Pandas** and **Jupyter Notebooks**.

The dataset used comes from [Enedis](https://www.enedis.fr/) – the subsidiary of French [EDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89lectricit%C3%A9_de_France#Distribution_network_(RTE_and_Enedis)) in charge of electricity distribution.  
More precisely, I am working with [this dataset: 📊 *Annual electricity consumption by address for companies*](https://data.enedis.fr/explore/dataset/consommation-annuelle-entreprise-par-adresse/).

I picked this dataset because I’ll soon be working at **Enedis**, and it’s a nice opportunity to start exploring their Open Data while refreshing my data analysis skills.

## Goals

- Explore the dataset in a **rough notebook** (data cleaning, first insights).
- Create a **cleaner presentation notebook** with visualizations and comments.
- Possibly experiment with **Jupyter’s slide generator** to turn the notebook into a mini-presentation.

## Tools and stack

- Python 🐍
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualization

👉 This is not intended to be a large-scale project, but rather a hands-on exercise to get back in touch with the data science workflow.
